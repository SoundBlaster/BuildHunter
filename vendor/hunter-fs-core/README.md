# hunter-fs-core

Std-only primitives extracted from BuildHunter `src/lib.rs` at 13aece6.
`visit_directory` consumes a host-opened directory iterator, observes file types
without following targets, emits owned Entry/Error values and checks cancellation
before type lookup. The host owns open/access/cloud policy, marker decisions,
recursion, worker scheduling and report/status aggregation. Failed open emits one
Error then OpenFailed; other iteration/type errors emit Error and continue.
A cancelled pass keeps its emitted prefix. Empty iteration completes even if the
stop predicate would be true, preserving the previous loop behavior. No blocking
syscall interruption or descriptor-bound/atomic tree guarantee is claimed.

`metadata_bytes` and `MeasuredSize` preserve apparent `len`, Unix allocated
`blocks * 512` (saturating) and non-Unix `len` fallback. They do not perform I/O,
filter file types, deduplicate hard links or estimate reclaimable disk space.
The boolean selects apparent bytes when true and allocated bytes when false.

This package has no external dependencies. It is separate from Unix `hunter-fs`,
which uses libc. Consumers needing fresh-cache offline builds may vendor the exact
Cargo.toml/LICENSE/src/lib.rs snapshot, recording the upstream revision and hashes.
That vendored copy is distribution of Hunter source, not a second implementation.

Tests cover cancellation prefix, open/iteration error ordering, empty directories,
file/directory/link types, sparse sizes, hard links and Linux raw names.
No live cloud, recursive race, memory or throughput acceptance is inferred.
